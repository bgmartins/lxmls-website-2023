Important Dates
---------------
* Application Deadline: May 15, 2023
* Decision: June 2, 2023
* Early Registration: June 2 - June 30, 2023
* Summer School: July 14 - 20, 2023


Topics and Intended Audience
---------------
The school will cover a range of Machine Learning (ML) topics, from theory to practice, that are important in solving Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems that arise in the analysis and use of Web data.

Our target audience is:
* Researchers and graduate students in the fields of NLP and Computational Linguistics;
* Computer scientists who have interests in statistics and machine learning;
* Industry practitioners who desire a more in depth understanding of these subjects.

Features of LxMLS:
* No deep previous knowledge of ML or NLP is required, but the attendants are assumed to have some basic background on mathematics and programming;
* Days are divided into morning lectures and afternoon lab sessions and practical talks (see schedule);
* The Labs guide will be provided one month in advance. Last year's guide is available on the website.
* A day zero is scheduled to review basic concepts and introduce the necessary tools for implementation exercises
* Both basic (e.g linear classifiers) and advanced topics (e.g. deep learning, reinforcement learning) will be covered
* Welcome reception, Banquet, daily lunch as well as morning and afternoon coffee breaks are included in the application fee
* Lecturers are leading researchers in machine learning and natural language processing
