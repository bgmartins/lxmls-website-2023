Our target audience is:
 * Researchers and graduate students in the fields of NLP and Computational Linguistics;
 * Computer scientists who have interests in statistics and machine learning;
 * Industry practitioners who desire a more in depth understanding of these subjects.

Features of LxMLS:
* No deep previous knowledge of ML or NLP is required, but the attendants are assumed to have some basic background on mathematics and programming;
* Days are divided into morning lectures and afternoon lab sessions and practical talks (see schedule);
* The Labs guide will be provided one month in advance. Last year's guide is available on the website.
* The first day is scheduled to review basic concepts and introduce the necessary tools for implementation exercises
* Both basic (e.g linear classifiers) and advanced topics (e.g. deep learning and transformers) will be covered
* Welcome reception, Banquet, daily lunch as well as morning and afternoon coffee breaks are included in the application fee
* Lecturers are leading researchers in machine learning and natural language processing
